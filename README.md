# Big-Data

The incredible volume and continued growth of data and its associated derived knowledge have created an insurmountable gap between the amount of data to be reviewed and the ability of a human individual to ‘take it all in’ in order to make a considered decision (derive valuable insights and knowledge).Companies have addressed this issue by creating applications to automate the process of decisioning: providing graphs, dashboards and useful subsets of the data to the human users that need the data for their day‐to‐day jobs.
Big Data applications span multiple business contexts, from social media to financial interactions to scientific computing.

Application
Effective Big Data applications dynamically handle the retrieval of decisions results based on stored large datasets efficiently.
In a Big Data environment, the largest problem is not obtaining the data or even storing it, but rather getting useful answers derived from the raw data within a reasonable timeframe.

But what is Big Data?

• Big Data is a blanket term.
–Usually used to describe any collection of data sets considered to be too large and complex to easily manage, curate, and process using traditional means.
– “Big Data” is thrown around so much in business and scientific contexts, with such varied meanings, that a quick moment to clarify the meaning of our context is not out of place…

How big is “Big”?
Companies have been storing and analyzing large volumes of data since the advent of data warehouses in the early 1990s. While terabytes used to be synonymous with Big Data warehouses, now it’s petabytes, and the rate of growth in data volumes continues to escalate
– organizations seek to store and analyze greater levels of transaction details & machine‐generated data
– to gain a better understanding of customer behavior and business drivers

Considerations: 3 Vs
Volume 1: Volume
– How MUCH data
Variety 2: Variety
The big ones!
– Different TYPES and/or FORMATS of data, from different sources
Velocity 3: Velocity
– How FAST is the data accumulating? How fast is it being processed and how fast must it be processed?
Veracity 4: Veracit…and 3 more V’s
– Accuracy, Quality, Truthfulness and Trustworthiness
• Variability
– Data Flows can have peaks and inconsistencies
• Value Proposition
– by analyzing large and feature‐rich data,
organizations can gain greater business value than they could otherwise gain.

Are there any more V’s?
Academic, Scientific, and Industrial communities are still deciding.
Since the exact definition of Big Data is a matter of ongoing discussion in academic and industrial circles, it is likely that more characteristics (perhaps more Vs) will be added to this list.

But why is data important?

Big Data by itself, regardless of the size, type, or speed of the data, is worthless unless business users do something with it that delivers value to their organizations.
“Big” Analytics
– The excitement around Big Data is about its value proposition.
– A preconceived notion about Big Data is that it contains
(or has a greater potential to contain) more patterns and interesting anomalies than “small” data.
– Big analytics can mean greater insight and better decision
making—something that every organization needs.

Analysis of Big Data
• Different types of data lend themselves to different analysis techniques:
–Descriptive analysi
Statistical functions (Max, Min, Avg, etc.) describe the dataset being reviewed.
Data tables, Graphics and Charts, and explanatory text.
Typically used with structured data.

Analysis of Big Data
• Different types of data lend themselves to different analysis techniques:
– Inductive analysis

Begin with concrete examples of data: apply qualitative methods to understand the domain and to determine what the important factors are.
Great when you don’t know what insights to expect from the data.
Typically used with unstructured data.

Why do we do it?
Extracting and providing much‐needed insight and knowledge to decision-makers at all levels
f the managerial hierarchy
data mining was originally used to describe the process through which previously unknown patterns in data were discovered
data analytics is now an overarching term for all data analysis, as the science of knowledge discovery

Having knowledge implies that it can be exercised to solve a problem, whereas having information does not carry the same meaning.

High‐performance computing
To keep up with the computational needs of Big Data, a number of new and innovative computational techniques and platforms are being developed:

In‐memory analytics
In‐database analytics
– performing data integration and analytic functions
inside the database so you don’t have to move or convert data repeatedly.

Grid computing
Appliances
– Hardware and software together in a single unit – Fast, but can also be scaled as needed

Technologies
Processing and analyzing Big Data
• Commodity hardware
– Scale-out and parallel‐processing techniques 
– Often employ non‐relational data storage
• Process unstructured and semi‐structured data
– Apply advanced analytics and data visualization
